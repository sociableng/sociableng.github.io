I did this one the hard way using cut and paste on    <a href="https://www.asciitohex.com/">https://www.asciitohex.com/</a>. I
    lost track of how many times I had to decode (turns out 25 after examining
    the code), but eventually the answer was revealed. After the challenge I
    decide to go back and look at the code and try to learn how to do it the
    smarter way.
</p>
<p>
    I downloaded the file and chmod the javascript file so I could run it. I
    ended up with and error and figured I needed to edit something in the code.

    After digging a bit, I realized this was the code that was used to encrypt
    the cipher.txt file.

</p>
<p>
    I also realized that the weird error I was getting had to do with not
    running .js files properly. After some googling, I installed NodeJS from
    the repo on kali. &lt;apt install nodejs –y&gt;
</p>
<p>
    After that I could run a test file with less cycles so I could test my
    corrected file.

    This was a classic buffer overflow problem. I went to the server using the
    provided link and cram the buffer with ‘A’s. When it crashed I typed “ls”
    to get the files and cat out the flag.txt file for the answer.

<p>
    I attempted a couple of other problems, but never did manage to solve.

    Hopefully this walkthrough would help someone. Please be nice, it’s my
    first one.
